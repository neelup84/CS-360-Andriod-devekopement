Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

It was necessary to build an app that contained a database for storing daily weights, a target weight, and a username/password for logging in. Users should be able to log in or sign up using a single button that will add them to the database of user/passwords if they don't already exist. It would be nice if users could delete their daily weights. You should be able to set the target weight and edit it later. Developed to address the user's need for tracking daily weight and assessing it against a target. If the user reaches the target, the app should notify them. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Among the screens needed were: login, home, history, adding a record, setting and editing goals, and permissions. With each screen having a primary function, the app was easy to use. I kept the user in mind in my design by providing a simple and friendly interface. The purpose of the screens and how to interact with them are clear. The designs make it clear and easy to interact with, pleasing users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

It was challenging to code my app. I started by designing the user interface. After that, I worked on the database and Java. First, I tried using fragments and instances. I then chose to use activities. I could manipulate the display and data with each activity's Java class, which was much more convenient. Not sure how much I can use these skills in the future.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I mainly tested the app on emulators. Unfortunately, as with many school projects, time slipped away from me, and I did not do any JUnit tests. I would have managed my time to test this app entirely. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Innovation was required in the database functions. I needed a system that could dynamically populate a list of weights based on their entry date. In the beginning, I did this by creating a fragment, then calling it for each weight. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

My best work was done on the user interface. However, in my opinion, the UI is clean and minimalist. On the other hand, I believe the backend needs improvement, particularly the loops. Furthermore, I found the login to be handy in my case. Overall it is a great project
